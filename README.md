About the Book
==============
This book features content from *Sams Teach Yourself HTML & CSS in 24 Hours* plus content from Michael Moncour’s *Sams Teach Yourself JavaScript in 24 Hours* (4th ed.). I am grateful to Phil Ballard for pitching in on some text and giving it the general once-over as technical editor. 

The goal of this book is to give you a taste of all the skills you need to create a modern, standards-compliant web site using XHTML and CSS (discussing HTML 5 where applicable, although it is not a how-to for HTML 5) with some level of interactivity and dynamism using JavaScript and JavaScript libraries.

This book is not intended as the be-all and end-all of your education in this matter: it’s a **first step**, which will hopefully illuminate the pathways of all the other steps you will need to take to become an expert in these areas.

The book's ISBN is 0672333325, and was published by Sams in 2012.
