About the Book
==============
This book features content from my *Sams Teach Yourself HTML & CSS in 24 Hours* (9th ed.) plus a wee bit of content from Phil Ballard's and Michael Moncour’s *Sams Teach Yourself JavaScript in 24 Hours* (5th ed.), and Brad Dayley's *Sams Teach Yourself jQuery and JavaScript in 24 Hours*. 

The goal of this book is to give you a taste of many the skills you need to create a modern, standards-compliant web site using HTML5 and CSS with some level of interactivity and dynamism using JavaScript and JavaScript libraries. A few additional chapters are devoted specifically to some first steps with jQuery and jQuery UI.

This book is not intended as the be-all and end-all of your education in this matter: it’s a **first step**, which will hopefully illuminate the pathways of all the other steps you will need to take to become an expert in these areas.

The book's ISBN is 0672337142, and will be published by Sams in October 2014.
